Nov 13 22:37:53.000 [notice] Tor 0.4.5.16 opening new log file.
Nov 13 22:37:53.621 [notice] We compiled with OpenSSL 101010ef: OpenSSL 1.1.1n  15 Mar 2022 and we are running with OpenSSL 1010117f: 1.1.1w. These two versions should be binary compatible.

Nov 13 22:37:59.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We have no usable consensus.

Nov 13 22:38:00.000 [warn] At least one protocol listed as recommended in the consensus is not supported by this version of Tor. You should upgrade. This version of Tor will eventually stop working as a client on the Tor network. The missing protocols are: FlowCtrl=2 Relay=4
Nov 13 22:38:00.000 [notice] The current consensus has no exit nodes. Tor can only build internal paths, such as paths to onion services.

Nov 13 22:38:00.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We need more microdescriptors: we have 0/9224, and can only build 0% of likely paths. (We have 0% of guards bw, 0% of midpoint bw, and 0% of end bw (no exits in consensus, using mid) = 0% of path bw.)
